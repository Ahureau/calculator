# calculator
A calculator created as the final challenge for the odin project's foundation course.
The calculator should have additions, subscrations, divisions, and multiplications.

Known bugs:

- Input line should not be able to become longer than the screen.
- When equal is pressed, it should be possible to start a new operation from
    that result.
- When a result is given, pressing a new value should start a new operation.
